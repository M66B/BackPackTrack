The plugin extends the WordPress XML-RPC protocol to enable the belonging Android application to create posts and to attach and update GPX files.

The Android application will periodically turn on the GPS of your device and acquire and record your position.
You can make waypoints on important locations, which you can optionally reverse geocode when you have an internet connection.

During or after your journey, you can create and upload a GPX file to your WordPress weblog.
The first upload creates a draft post with the title of your journey and a hyperlink to the generated GPX file.
Subsequent uploads will only update the GPX file.

The GPX file can be displayed as a map using the XML Google Maps WordPress plugin.

The Android application is designed for low power and offline use.
If you want to continuously track your position, you can better use My Tracks, although this application doesn't have an option to upload GPX files to your weblog.
